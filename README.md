- Brief Explanation of the task -
  
The script creates a folder structure in a React application, where each folder and file is displayed in a tree-like view. The folders can be expanded and collapsed to show or hide their contents. When a file is clicked, its content is displayed. If a folder is collapsed, any displayed file content is cleared.

Key Features:

   1. Folder and File Hierarchy: Displays folders and files in a nested structure.
   2. Expand/Collapse Folders: Users can expand or collapse folders to show or hide their contents.
   3. File Content Display: Clicking a file shows its content. Collapsing a folder clears the displayed file content.
   4. Sample File Content: Each file contains predefined sample content.
